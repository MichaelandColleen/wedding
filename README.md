Firstly, a big thanks 🙏🏻 for the overwhelming response on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18556787) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/a1bx4h/i_am_open_sourcing_my_wedding_website_on_my_first/). I would be more than happy for [PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) or [gifts](https://www.paypal.me/ramswaroop) ;) Just kidding, ignore it. A follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ram__patra) would be just fine.
